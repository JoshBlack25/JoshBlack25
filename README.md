## Hey, I'm Joshua Adams 👋


Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a passionate student currently pursuing a Diploma in Application Development at CPUT. My journey into the world of IT started the moment I powered up my first desktop PC, and it's been nothing but curiosity and discovery since then. From tinkering with hardware to diving deep into code, I’ve never looked back.

🔐 What I'm Into Right Now
These days, I’m all about Cybersecurity — learning how to protect systems, find vulnerabilities, and secure the digital world. Alongside that, I’m diving into different languages and frameworks, including:
Java 🖥️
HTML & CSS 🌐
Python 🐍
